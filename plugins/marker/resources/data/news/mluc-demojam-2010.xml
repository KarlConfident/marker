MarkLogic will hold a demo contest, called DemoJam, on May 3rd, 2010 at the MarkLogic User Conference opening reception.  
Everyone is welcome! The demo must be under 5 minutes and must be of technical nature. 
The crowd will vote on the winner. Winner takes home an iPad.  DemoJam started as an internal MarkLogic contest 
that we have expanded to include our developer community. Because of the great enthusiasm this 
event receives, we have to put a ceiling on the number of demos to be presented. Submit your demo now 
and we will invite the top 10 to compete at the User Conference event.

<b><i>Submit your demos by April 21st at demojam at marklogic dot com</i></b> 
<br/>
Submissions should include a brief textual description of the demo.  
You're welcome, but not required, to provide screen shots or screen casts as well.  
MarkLogic will provide an Internet connection but presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptops.
