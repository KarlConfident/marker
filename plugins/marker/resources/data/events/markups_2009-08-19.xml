In recent years, the term "semantic applications" has expanded beyond its original RDF roots to include applications that are increasingly leveraging relevant metadata to allow users to more quickly and intelligently discover and analyze data within broad content sets. In this session, MarkLogic Federal Consultant Gary Katz will discuss MarkLogic Server's role as a semantically enabling technology, the problems it can help solve as well as demonstrate a recently developed semantic application.
